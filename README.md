##### Introduction
In this readme you can find how you put the project on your local computer and run it.
From there, you will be able to put it online and make sure it runs without errors.

**NOTE: If you have no .XML file witch belongs with the project, you will not be able to run the project**  

##### Step 1:
Clone this project
(if you have no idea how, I advise you not to fiddle with this project).

##### Step 2:
Go to the project file: 'wp-content/themes/Leid-op'. From here, run npm install in terminal. This will install the dependencies.

##### Step 3: 
Run Gulp. If you have no Node.js installed, go to https://nodejs.org/en/.
If you have no Gulp installed, run 'npm install --global gulp-cli' in the terminal.

From here, Gulp will build the files to a Dist folder. This is the root folder in the project.

##### Step 4:
Follow the steps in the documentary 'Realisatie Verslag'. Here is described how you import the database in the project. (this is also where you will need the .XML file)   

##### Step 5:
If you run into any problems on the way, send a message to the product owner or any of the contributors.
